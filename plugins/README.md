# Plugins

Here you can browse additional plugins available for your game. 

The README file in each repository should tell you all about the plugin, including what support you can expect with it.  Plugins in the AresMUSH organization are official (meaning you can report bugs the same way you would with the main Ares code) while others are contributed by the community and supported by their individual authors.

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins directly from the game using `plugin/install <github url>`. For example:  `plugin/install https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-prefs-plugin`.
  
**Note:!** 

1. Make sure the plugin is compatible with your version of AresMUSH.  Most require the latest version.
2. Many plugins require some additional manual install steps.  Be sure to check the README file in each plugin's folder for detailed information on installation and configuration.
