# Themes

Here you can browse themes for your web portal.  Themes will include colors, custom styles and/or images.

## Browsing Themes

Each of the repos below should have a README file with example images showing what the theme looks like:

* [Ares Dark](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-dark-theme) - Dark-background version of the default Ares theme.

## Installing Themes

To install a theme, use `theme/install <github url>` with an admin character in-game. For example: `theme/install https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-dark-theme`.

> **Note:** Doing this will overwrite your current web portal theme. The files will be backed up to the `aresmush/theme_archive` folder if you need to get them back.

To contribute a theme, see [Ares Extras Contributions](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/code/extra-contribs.html).

## Restoring the Default Theme

Use `theme/install default` to restore the default Ares theme.
